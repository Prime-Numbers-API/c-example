# [Prime-numbers-API ](https://prime-numbers-api.com)

Welcome to Prime Numbers API (https://prime-numbers-api.com), the largest commercial database of prime numbers in the world!

Here we have more than __5 billion__ curated primes from the first __130 billion composite numbers__, and counting!



### [Overview](https://prime-numbers-api.com/index.php?route=journal3/blog)
Whether you're a scientist, security expert, or you simply love math, Prime Numbers has something to offer you!

In the last 3 and a half years, we've invested over 1 500 human-hours, over 50 000 computer-hours, with an average processing speed of 4 300 composite numbers per second while using 100% green energy. We've taken the leg work out of finding primes, so you can focus on using them.

We've also translated the output into 8 of the most commonly used languages, including __Mandarin__, __Hindi__, __Spanish__, __French__, __German__, __Italian__, __Japanese__, and __Russian__, making the Prime Numbers the most accessible API for finding prime numbers in the world!

If you’re looking for help with encryption, gain access to our __exclusive isolated primes endpoint__ and you can filter for rare primes that lie at least 200, and even up to 500+ numbers away from their closest neighbors! The average probability of finding one of the isolated prime numbers by accident is 1 in over 800,000 (or 0.000124565509%)! The chances of being struck by lightning are 1 in 500,000! Now that’s a strong password!

Our API conveniently translates the language of your smart devices. Every number is returned with its respective translation into binary, senary, and hexa values.

Furthermore, each prime number you receive from the API is home-grown, curated, and 100% genuine; and it even comes with its very own __birth certificate__! No copies, clones, or placeholders here! 

The API results have a multitude of configurations. These range from simple and fast to incredibly verbose, with extensive explanations for each field. Whether you're looking for efficient server-to-server communication or you're in need of prime numbers for educational or research purposes, the results can be custom-tailored to suit your needs!

With these prime types outputs, you can determine:
* __Isolated__: rare prime numbers with an average density of 0.000124565509% that are 200 to 500+ composite numbers away from each of their neighbours
* __Palindromes__: primes which reads the same backwards as forwards (examples: 101, 373, 919)
* __Twins__: primes that are no more than 2 composite numbers from each other (examples: (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19))
* __Cousins__: primes that are no more than 4 composite numbers from each other (examples: (7, 11), (37, 41), (43, 47))
* __Sexys__: primes that are no more than 6 composite numbers from each other (examples: (7,13), (13,19), (23,29))
* __Reversibles__: primes that become a different prime when their decimal digits are reversed (examples: 37, 107, 149)
* __Pandigitals__: primes in a base has at least one instance of each base digit (examples: 2143 (base 4), 7654321 (base 7))
* __Repunits__: primes are positive integers in which every digit is one (examples: 11, 1111111111111111111)
* __Mersenne__: primes that is of the form 2n - 1 (one less than a power of two) for some integer n (examples: 3 (2^2 - 1), 7 (2^3 - 1), 31 (2^5 - 1) )
* __Fibonacci__: primes that are also Fibonacci numbers (examples: 89, 233, 1597)
* __Prime type densities__: how many prime type numbers in percentage can be found in every million composite numbers
* ...and so much more!
 

Whether you're just looking for efficient server-to-server communication, or you're in need of prime numbers for educational or research purposes, the results can be custom tailored to suit your needs!
